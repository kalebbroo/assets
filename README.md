# FAQ
Q: What's the difference between seg_60 / seg2_60 and seg_400 / seg_800 variations? what do these numbers mean?
A: These are some personal annotations of mine. The numbers at the end, such as 60, 400, 800, represent training epochs and do not necessarily indicate which is superior or inferior. When encountering unsatisfactory detection results for certain images, consider switching to another one; you might find better outcomes.

Q: Where can l find the hand model?
A: In Progress. If you are in a hurry, you can use it in https://huggingface.co/Bingsu/adetailer
Download hand_yolov8n.pt or hand_yolov8s.pt to generate rectangular masks.
